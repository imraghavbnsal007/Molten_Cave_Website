# Molten_Cave_Website
A working food restaurant website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript. This was my first year project
Problem Description

This website is based on a restaurant named as MoltenCave. This website is for a food ordering. I think it will be a unique idea to make a website on a restaurant and food items. All pages are connected to each other and user will find information on all of them. Each page will focus on a restaurant what they provide, how they provide a dish, way they provide. I Assume there are some big branches of this restaurant in different countries. There are 5 pages, Home, Variety, Service, about us, Contact us. Each page explains the food at its best followed by images and videos. Many websites on internet just provide you food, but this website will show dishes that are most famous in all over world and eaten by many people and will give some Fun-Fact.

Research

Before starting this website, I did some research what content I should make, then I choose food. Now I have to find some source or idea from other websites, and they helped me a lot. Website like Dominos.com, Deliveroo.com, Swiggy.com, Zomato.com. I did not go to any restaurant website because website like swiggy will show a full content to restaurant and for layout design I observe that your nav should look same throughout the website. Each website has its own images, its own content but the theme is quite attracting. I also decide to make my nav bar same and will put some images and video that will present my idea.

Technology Selection and Site Architecture

Here it is used HTML 5 and CSS 3. This site is accessible by users on any available platform - tablet, laptop, phone, etc. It adapts as it is responsive to the viewing device.
It will resize itself.

The website is created with five pages in total. The top of each page has a navigation bar (also known as menu bar) which provides an easy access to switch to different pages. All the pages have a footer at the bottom displaying the website name.
Our first page is home page. It has a nav bar with a restaurant logo on the left top corner and have nav bar options. It starts with background image with a login option. Login option will ask for username and password. It is just for showing it will not generate. After that we have our clients of our restaurant.
The second page displays variety. Its like a menu of our restaurant. I did not add much menu items just added burgers and pizza. This also start with nav bar and after that we have a slideshow image which keeps changing after 3 seconds. After that, I put 3 videos embedded from YouTube, showing “how our chefs prepare food”. Then we have our menu separated with tables. One table is of burger and other one is of pizza. There are three burgers variety and eight pizza variety. Then we have our order link which is directly connected to contact us page.

This page, which is service, I make that page pretty much simple but attractive, it contains our service what we provide. Our best service. All services are divided in three boxes with red border and an image on top of every box best thing is, if you resize that page that looks more interesting. I just wanted to make page like that. 

On fourth page that is about us page. It like our history and how we deal with stuff in our restaurant and our reviews by people, on the top left corner you’ll find ten columms which shows our restaurant features and on the right side corner there are some interesting and funny fan Facts. In the middle we have two links of Swiggy.com and Zomato.com. Because they both are our application for delivery. After that there are three videos that shows our restaurant franchise in future will look alike in different countries with different theme. Then our reviews, there you’ll find six photos. All people are totally different and trying our restaurant food and writing some interesting comment on our restaurant. Then there is footer with company name.

The last page that is contact form. It works as two type- first is just contacting and second is ordering food from us. There are basic option like first name, last name, address and phone number. There is option of a menu on that page that asks what you want to eat from our variety page and in what variety you want to eat then there is a check box that asks for payment method and then comment. 
There are five different CSS files here on this website instead of one. This is because I was facing a lot of difficulties in doing the padding and margins of different images and text inputs. Moreover, so many images and text inputs on a single CSS file looks very messy in this case.
